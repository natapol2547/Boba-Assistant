Example summary for an order (Adapt and use appropriate the examples according to the sistuations):

Order and specifications:

Product: printed box

Questions:
    What product (required)
    Box size (required)
    Amount of boxes/bags (required)
    Box Design for boxes/bags (required)
    

Specifications: 
    Box size (required question) Example: 6*5*4 cm. *(Size must not be more than A4 paper when unfolded) 
    
    Default Specifications:
    350 gram thick art card paper
    Four-color offset printing according to the designed file (joint lay)
    well coated
    Ready-to-use die cut glue
    (Customer can add custom Specifications)

Price Calculations:
    Amount of boxes/bags (required question)

    Price of each box depends on the amount of boxes bought such that:
    Customer can only order 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000 or 2000 boxes per order only (amount of boxes per order other than those is not valid).
    - 100 or 200 or 300 boxes order is 25 baht each box
    - 500 boxes order is 8 baht each box
    - 1000 or 2000 boxes order is 4.8 baht each box
    
    Example:
    Customer wants 1000 boxes. Each box is 4.80 baht. Meaning 1000 * 4.80 = 4,800 baht

design fee 1500 baht (If the user doesn't want a new design or already sent a design file [must send designs to Thaiprintshop.aw@gmail.com], the design fee is 0 baht)

Shipping fee 300 baht

Formula:
(Prices for production of boxes + Design fee + Shipping fee) * 1.07 (vat 7%) = Total Price

Example Casees:
Example 1 ---[Box size (Not more than A4 paper when unfolded): 6 x 6 x 4 cm. Amount: 1000 boxes ( 4.8 baht each box ) Box Design: Need a new one]---
1000 * 4.8 Baht = 4,800 Baht (Prices for production of boxes)
4,800 Baht + 1500 Baht (Design fee) + 300 Baht (Shipping fee) = 6,500 baht. Then 6,600 baht * 1.07 (vat 7%) = 7,062 baht

Example 2 ---[Box size (Not more than A4 paper when unfolded): 8 x 8 x 3 cm. Amount: 500 boxes ( 8 each box ) Box Design: Design file sent via Email (already designed)]---
500 * 8 Baht = 4,000 Baht (Prices for production of boxes)
4,000 Baht + 0 Baht (Design fee) + 300 Baht (Shipping fee) = 4,300 baht. Then 4,300 baht * 1.07 (vat 7%) = 4,601 baht

payment process:

Example 1:
Total price = 7,062 baht
Foumula: Total * 50% = initial deposit
Pay a deposit of 50% = 3,531 baht

Total * 30% = additional production deposit
30% additional production deposit = 2,118.6 baht

Total * 20% = Before submitting work deposit
Before submitting work 1,412.4 baht.
